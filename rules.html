            sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent,
            spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
            this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of

                  IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                  within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                  dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams

                  participating in the state competition program that are unable
                  to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must
                  advise the State Competition Board which will assign its
                  Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the
                  Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
                  be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that
                  are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to
                  play all their games away.
